I am a passionate IT professional with 4+ years of experience in Software development.

I have solid work experience in the following technologies and tools.

- Backend : NodeJS, ExpressJS, AWS-CDK
- Frontend : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, MUI, AntDesign
- Database : MongoDB, MySQL, DynamoDB
- version-control : Git
- Cloud : AWS

I am a quick learner and I love to work independently with dedication. Whether it's writing code or analyzing issue or testing the complete implementation, regardless of the time or complexity, I enjoy the happiness on completion.

I have a go-getter attitude. I am enthusiastic. I believe we should keep pushing our limits each day and never let any hurdles in between hold us back from achieving our dreams.
